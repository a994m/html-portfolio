<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>

  <p>My name is Mary, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.
   I'm currently in the process of building a portfolio of projects as part of the 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. This comprehensive course is equipping me with the skills needed to become a Full-Stack developer. I'm diving into topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, MongoDB, Web3, and DApps.
  
  In addition to the web development bootcamp, I'm also enrolled in another exciting course on Udemy called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023." Through this program, I'm mastering Python by completing 100 unique projects in just 100 days. This journey includes learning about data science, automation, and building websites, games, and applications.
  
  You might be wondering why I decided to embark on this journey. I've spent several years working in customer care services, but I've recognized that the future is all about IoT, AI, programming, and web development. This realization inspired me to challenge myself and make a career change to be a part of this exciting wave of technological innovation.
  
  In April, I began a course called "Analista Programmatore Web Oriented" at Cis, a reputable training school. This intensive program spans 500 hours, with 300 hours dedicated to theory and 200 hours to hands-on experience. Currently, I'm gaining practical experience through an internship at CF3000, a company located in Reggio Emilia. My primary project during this internship is the creation of a new website for the company using WordPress. Additionally, I've also developed a redirect page to guide users to the new website.
  
  I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead and eager to contribute my skills to the ever-evolving world of technology and web development. Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey, and I look forward to connecting with you.
